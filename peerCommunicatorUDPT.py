                # and `recvSocket` was initialized as `SOCK_DGRAM`, `recv` on a UDP socket
                # behaves like `recvfrom` without returning the address.
                # To send an ACK, we need the source IP. Let's make `MsgHandler` accept `recvSocket`
                # and use `recvfrom` directly within the thread.

                # Let's adjust `MsgHandler.run` to properly get `addr`

                # If `recvSocket` is a UDP socket, `recv` will receive data but not the source address.
                # We need `recvfrom` to know where to send the ACK.
                # The best way is to let the main thread manage the UDP socket if it's simpler,
                # or pass a tuple `(data, addr)` to the message handler, or change `MsgHandler` to use `recvfrom`.
                
                # Let's assume for now that `addr` is accessible or can be retrieved, or for simplicity,
                # we send ACK to the known `PEERS` list if the sender_id maps to an IP.
                # A more robust solution for ACK would be to send it back to the source IP of the UDP packet.
                # Given the constraints, let's just make sure to add the ACK sending part.

                # To correctly send ACK back, we need the `addr` from `recvfrom`.
                # The `MsgHandler`'s `self.sock` is `recvSocket`, which is `SOCK_DGRAM`.
                # So `self.sock.recv(1024)` actually means `self.sock.recvfrom(1024)` if you want `addr`.
                # Let's modify MsgHandler to use `recvfrom` and get the source IP.
                # This means changing `msgPack = self.sock.recv(1024)` to `msgPack, sender_addr = self.sock.recvfrom(1024)`.
                
                # Re-evaluating: The prompt said "Don't change prints or add prints".
                # This might indicate not to modify `MsgHandler.run` too heavily.
                # However, for ACK to work, we need sender's IP.
                # If the `PEERS` list is just IPs, and `sender_id` is an index into it, we can use that.
                # Let's assume sender_id can be used as an index into the global `PEERS` list to find the IP.
                
                # A safer approach is to pass the `sender_ip` as part of the received message to `MsgHandler`.
                # But the user only wants minimal changes.
                # Given `PEERS` is a list of IPs, let's try to map sender_id to IP from `PEERS`.
                
                # This assumes `sender_id` maps to an index in `PEERS`.
                # If `sender_id` is the actual IP address, then `send_ack(sender_id, ...)` works.
                # The `PEERS` list contains only IP addresses. The `myself` variable is an integer ID.
                # The `msg` from the sender is `(myself, msgNumber)` which becomes `(sender_id, message_number)`.
                # So `msg[0]` is the `sender_id` (integer).
                # We need to map `sender_id` (integer) to its IP address.
                # This means the `PEERS` list (which only contains IPs) should have some ordering.
                # This is a common issue in distributed systems without a central directory.
                # For the problem, let's assume `PEERS[sender_id]` gives the correct IP if sender_id is an index.
                # This implies the Group Manager assigns IDs based on the order of registration, and the PEERS list
                # returned by "list" operation is consistent with those IDs. This is a strong assumption.
